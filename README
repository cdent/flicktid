# Introduction

Proxy [Flickr](http://flickr.com) hosted photos into tiddlers
on a [TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com) sever.

The created tiddlers operate as proxies that redirect to the
original resource.

This allows photos to be referenced as tiddlers: links made as
tiddlers, messed about with with macros, etc.

# Examples

* http://csand.tiddlyspace.com/tiddlers.wiki#[[flicklinktest]]
* http://csand.tiddlyspace.com/flicklinktest
* http://csand.tiddlyspace.com/flicklinkmd
* http://csiurana.tiddlyspace.com/ and
  http://siurana-photos.tiddlyspace.com/tiddlers

# How

Install `flicktid` (instructions to be completed) and then run a command
similar to:

```
flicktid -v \
   --user=cdent \
   --pass=xxxxxx \
   72157633103289117 \
   http://siurana-photos.tiddlyspace.com/bags/siurana-photos_public/tiddlers
```

The last two arguments are:

* The ID associated with the Flickr set (look in the URL when
  viewing the set's Flickr page).
* The URL of the bag tiddlers where the proxy tiddlers are to be 
  created.

If a photo has a title, that will be used as the tiddler title. If it
does not, then the unique ID assigned by Flickr will be used. Tags will
be mapped to the tiddler, if they exist. `datetaken` and `dateupload`
fields will be set with unix time (seconds since the epoch) values.

At the moment the Flickr set is assumed to be public. If there's demand
Flickr auth could probably be added.

# Who

Created by Chris Dent, the author of TiddlyWeb, as a simple technology
demonstration. Hopefully useful to someone.
